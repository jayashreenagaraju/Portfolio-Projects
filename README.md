## Python Projects

- [**Vanguard Test control analysis**](https://github.com/jayashreenagaraju/vanguard-test-control-analysis)
  - **Conducted Client Behavior Analysis**: Analyzed client demographics and behavior using datasets on profiles, digital footprints, and experiment participation to identify primary users and their characteristics.
  - **Evaluated Performance Metrics and Conducted Hypothesis Testing**: Assessed key performance indicators such as completion rate, time spent per process step, error rate, and client tenure; performed hypothesis testing to determine gender differences and other factors affecting client behavior.
  - **Data Visualization and Presentation**: Created comprehensive visualizations in Tableau and documented findings in a detailed presentation and Miro board; developed analysis code in a Jupyter notebook for reproducibility.
